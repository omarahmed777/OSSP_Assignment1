# OSSP_Assignment1
BST implementation in C

**Personal note for running:** for some reason VSC is being weird and it may have to be run on the VM. Any updated changes should be pushed to this repo.
## Test Cases
**Please note: THE TEST CASES ARE NOT MINE**

Full credit goes to Chit and his contributors for collaborating and creating test cases for us to use. You can find his repo [here.](https://github.com/chit-uob/os_assignment_collab_test_cases)

While I did also contribute to Chit's repo, my contributions were purely editorial. These included grammar & consistency edits.

This is purely for archiving my own solution to the actual `bst.c` file, using Chit and co.'s `test_bst.c` file.

## Grade and potential issues
My final grade is for this assignment is: [Not yet graded]

As of 21/10/22 there ARE memory leaks, which I do intend to come back to and fix eventually, in my own time. However, for this assignment memory leaks will not negatively impact our grade and as this is the case, a working (but leaking) solution is sufficient. (People do still use Chrome, after all)
